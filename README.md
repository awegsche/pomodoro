# Pomodoro ‚è±Ô∏è

## What is Pomodoro?

**Pomodoro** is your personal activity tracker, designed to help you stay focused and organized!  
Easily manage multiple stopwatches for different tasks, track your progress, and keep a record of your productivity‚Äîall without needing to keep the app running in the background.

All your data is safely stored in `~/Documents/pomodoro.txt`, so you never lose track of your hard work.
